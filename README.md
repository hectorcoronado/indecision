### a repo created to learn React Fiber & React Router v4.

It's a todo app. But with a :cool:fancy name:shipit:.

#### From the terminal, run:

```
$ yarn run build
```

...which would be equivalent to running the following, if Webpack were installed globally:

```
$ webpack --watch
```

What does this command do?

#### ...and to fire up a barebones dev server:

```
$ yarn run devServer
```

...which uses `live-server` and serves up the `/public` directory, where the file that webpack outputs lives, `bundle.js`.
